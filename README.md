# Extremal-Sift-points
This program intends to extract the sift features from extremal regions. 
# The stepwise manner mentioned as follow will guide you about the overall program execution.

# Step 1: Try to execute the SIFT-points-detection-in-MSER.py file in terminal, before execution be sure to have opencv, matplotlib and all necessary packages that help in smooth execution of the program.

# Step 2:	Then install RNNLIB library from https://github.com/szcom/rnnlib, this library will help you to train the extracted SIFT features appeared in conjoined area of binary image and image mask.

# Step 3: Pass (x,y) coordinates of selected SIFT features along with labels to RNN.
